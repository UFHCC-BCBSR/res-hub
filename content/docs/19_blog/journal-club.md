## Review Papers

*Comprehensive reviews that provide foundational knowledge and current state-of-the-art in key bioinformatics areas*

[Chromatin accessibility profiling methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00010-1)

---

## Benchmarking Papers

*Benchmarking papers compare methods to determine, based on a set of parameters and often empirical and simulated data, what the "best" tool is for a particular analysis. Tools are evaluated on speed and accuracy, usually. (Keep in mind these papers are often published to introduce a new tool, and therefore may be biased.)*

- [Benchmarking RNA-seq differential expression analysis methods using spike-in and simulation data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192453/)
- [Benchmarking scRNA-seq copy number variation callers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62359-9)

## Reproducibility

*Understanding the importance of and tools for reproducibility is critical for bioinformatics work.*

[The five pillars of computational reproducibility: bioinformatics and beyond](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad375)

---

## Multi-omics

*Integrating diverse biological data types (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to gain comprehensive insights into complex biological systems*

[Multi-Omics Data Integration in Cancer Research](https://www.nature.com/research-intelligence/nri-topic-summaries/multi-omics-data-integration-in-cancer-research-micro-62206)

---

## Eye on Relevant New Methods

*Recently published methods and tools that represent significant advances or novel approaches in computational biology*

- [hUSI is a robust transcriptome-based cellular senescence prediction tool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00894-2)
- [Novel cancer subtyping method guided by tumor-normal sample in latent space of transcriptomic variational autoencoder](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07813-w)
